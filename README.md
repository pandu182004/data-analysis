# 🚀 Welcome to My Data Analyst Portfolio 

> “Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.” – Tim Berners-Lee

Hi there! 👋  
This repository is a curated collection of real-world data analysis tasks I completed as part of the **Cognifyz Data Analyst Internship**.  
Each notebook is a mini project that explores various analytical techniques using **Python**, with a special focus on **EDA**, **visual storytelling**, and **geospatial insights**.

## 🧩 What's Inside?

| 📁 Notebook | 🔍 Focus Area | 📌 Techniques |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| `task1.ipynb` | 🔎 Data Understanding & Cleaning | Null analysis, dtype checks, handling missing data |
| `task2.ipynb` | 📊 Exploratory Data Visualization | Histograms, bar charts, pie charts, correlation matrix |
| `task3.ipynb` | 🗺️ GeoData Analysis | Plotting states/cities using GeoPandas |
| `task4.ipynb` | 🔥 Interactive Mapping | HeatMaps using Folium & plugins |
|`task5.ipynb`  | 📍 Location-Based Filtering  | Creating maps with location constraints, zoom control, custom map layers |
| `task6.ipynb`  | 📌 Marker-Based Visualization | Adding markers, popups, clustered markers on interactive maps |

## 🛠️ Toolkit

🧰 Here are the tools and libraries I used across the projects:

- `pandas` – data manipulation  
- `numpy` – numerical calculations  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – visual storytelling  
- `geopandas` – spatial data representation  
- `folium` – interactive leaflet maps  
- `jupyter notebook` – all-in-one notebook interface

## 🌟 Key Highlights

✅ Cleaned and preprocessed real datasets  
✅ Built insightful visualizations (charts & geospatial maps)  
✅ Created interactive HeatMaps using Folium  
✅ Applied storytelling techniques for business impact
