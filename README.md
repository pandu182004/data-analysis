# 🚀 Welcome to My Data Analyst Portfolio 

> “Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.” – Tim Berners-Lee

Hi there! 👋  
This repository is a curated collection of real-world data analysis tasks I completed as part of the **Cognifyz Data Analyst Internship**.  
Each notebook is a mini project that explores various analytical techniques using **Python**, with a special focus on **EDA**, **visual storytelling**, and **geospatial insights**.

## 🛠️ Toolkit

🧰 Here are the tools and libraries I used across the projects:

- `pandas` – data manipulation  
- `numpy` – numerical calculations  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – visual storytelling

💡 Key Insights
Most restaurants have ratings between 3.0 and 4.5

North Indian and Fast Food are among the most popular cuisines

Online delivery availability slightly impacts average customer satisfaction

Cities like Gurgaon, Bangalore, and New Delhi top the charts in average ratings

Major chains follow predictable trends in location and ratings


📎 Why This Project?
